I wandered across the OMISS 40m net last night, it ended up with over 100 check-ins by the time the night was over (and it was over LATE! ~04:05 UTC).
I was able to work Josh AJ2G in Tipton, IA, Michael KJ7FX in ID, and Terry KC3FSO in PA.

Early in the net, several IL stations were booming in (especially Jeff K9TZZ in Springfield), but by the time things started to wrap up, I failed a QSO with Matthew KD9ERS.

Anyway, I recieved good signal reports all around, including an unsolicited one from net control, Carrie W9FML in WI.
