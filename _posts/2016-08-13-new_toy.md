I finally got around to putting together the [USB antenna rotator interface kit](https://remoteqth.com/single-rotator-interface.php) that I had ordered Czech Republic ages ago.

It seems to work just fine, but I haven't got it wired up to the [Yaesu G-800SA rotator](http://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&ProdCatID=104&encProdID=79D3952BA5CCB0D0672C19F58BE1B0F6&DivisionID=65&isArchived=0) that I got this Spring from AES at what turned out to be their last SuperFest.

The plan so far will be to cable this box and the K3 up to the roof where I'll put a tripod, the rotator, mast, and a [hex beam](http://www.radiowavz.com/sentinel-hex-beam-6-band-6m-10m-12m-15m-17-20m/).
