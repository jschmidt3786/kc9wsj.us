40m!
It took a bit of work with the Buddipole, but I've got it resonant at about the middle of the band.

Up until now, I've only focused on 20m. The Buddipole tunes effortlessly on 20, so it's easy to setup/take down.

I do have a single QSL on 40, made to Macedonia (Z36T) while I was visiting Jack W9MU's shack, on his beast of a Yaesu rig. If Dave Bowman sat down at that rig, he'd say, ["My God, it's full of ~~stars~~ knobs!"][omgstars].

Time to make some QSOs!
