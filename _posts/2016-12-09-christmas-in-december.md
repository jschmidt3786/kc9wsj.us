Ok, I finally did it. I ordered my [6-band, 6-20m HexBeam](http://www.radiowavz.com/sentinel-hex-beam-6-band-6m-10m-12m-15m-17-20m/) from Radiowavz.

So now I'll have full coverage from 6m down to 20m, and can tune the Buddipole to 40m, albeit compromised. And speaking of compromises, it looks like the Hex Beam will be in the attic for a while.
