I tested [here][races] for my Technician license on 2012-10-08 and received call KC9WSJ on 2012-10-16.
Fast forward to Feb 2016, and I finally went for my General - only missed one!

I currently don't own a mobile rig, but do have a well-optioned [Yaesu VX-8DR][vx8dr] from [Ham City][hamcity], though I rarely listen in on the local VHF repeaters.

HF, on the other hand, is Where It's Atâ„¢.
For this endeavour, I've put together an [Elecraft K3][elecraft], in about four stages. One more stage to go - the [KPA500][kpa500] is calling my name...
