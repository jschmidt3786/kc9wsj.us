# My Shack

I've assembled an [Elecraft][elecraft] K3/100 & P3 panadapter, pictured here.

The K3 has the following components, in the order I added them:

* KBPF3 general coverage receive bandpass module (mainly for SWL)
* KDVR3 digital voice recorder
* KTCXO3-1 high stability reference oscillator
* KXV3A receive antenna, IF out and transverter interface 
* KAT3 auto-tuner
* KPA3 100W power amp (the unit started out as a K3/10)
* K144XV 2-meter transverter module
* K144RFLK reference lock board for the K144XV
* KRX3 sub-receiver

And these filters:

* __main receiver__
  *    KFL3B-FM 13 kHz FM
  *    KFL3A-6K 6 kHz AM/ESSB 8-pole
  *    KFL3A-2.8 2.8 kHz 8-pole
  *    KFL3A-1.8 1.8 kHz 8-pole
  *    KFL3A-400 400 Hz 8-pole
* __sub receiver__
  *    KFL3A-6K 6 kHz AM/ESSB 8-pole
  *    KFL3A-2.8 2.8 kHz 8-pole
  *    KFL3A-1.8 1.8 kHz 8-pole
  *    KFL3A-400 400 Hz 8-pole

The P3 has the P3SVGA video adapter installed.

I've tricked out the units w/ custom brass serial number plates and acrylic faceplates from [Ken, WB2ART][wb2art], and **heavy** nickel-plated bronze VFO A/B knobs from Bulgaria, courtesy of [Boris, LZ2JR][lz2jr]. 

Also pictured is my Yaesu VX-8DR hand-held for mobile VHF/UHF and APRS.
